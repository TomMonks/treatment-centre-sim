# 1. Objectives

## 1.1 Purpose of the model

```{admonition} Primary purpose
The simulation model provides a framework for decision makers to evaluate the impact of alternative working processes on queues and other efficiency criteria in the first treatment health centre.  
```

## 1.2 Model Outputs

At the end of a model run the average waiting times and resource utilisation is calculated for each of the following activities.

* Patient triage
* Registration
* Examination
* Non-trauma patient treatment
* Trauma patient treatment

The model also calculates total time in system separately for trauma and non-trauma patients.  Confidence intervals are generated using multiple replications.

## 1.3 Experimentation aims

A simple scenario based analysis.  The following experiments are included:

* Increasing triage capacity by +1
* Increasing examination capacity by +1
* Increasing non-trauma capacity by +1
* Combining additional triage and additional examination capacity
