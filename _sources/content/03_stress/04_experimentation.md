# 4. Experimentation

## 4.1 Initialisation

The model is treated as terminating i.e. the treatment centre opens at 6am (assumed empty) and closes at 12am (18 hours).  

## 4.2 Run length

The time units used in the model are minutes and a run length of 18 hours is used (a single opening day).

## 4.3 Estimation approach

As the system is terminating, multiple independent replications are employed to account for stochasticty. Common random numbers are employed between scenarios.  A total of 5 replications are run for each experiment.
