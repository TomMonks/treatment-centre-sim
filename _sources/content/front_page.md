This book contains example documentation and open working for a computer simulation model.  It is a supplementary material to the article 'Open Science for Computer Simulation' [1]. The model is a based on the treatment centre example in Nelson [2]. The model is implemented in Python and SimPy.

The book covers the following aspects of open working for simulation:

* Sharing your model code and parameters with other researchers and simulation modellers.
* An example of documenting your model using the STRESS reporting checklist (for DES).
* Providing a simple executable version of your model for other to verify results.
